# Skills Reference — Pantheon

## Overview

Skills are reference modules loaded on demand by agents. Each skill provides domain-specific knowledge — architecture patterns, security checklists, optimization strategies, and implementation guides. Agents load skills when their task matches the skill's description, keeping context focused and token-efficient.

There are **37 skills** divided into **9 domains**.

## Skills File Structure

Each skill follows a consistent layout:

```
skills/[skill-name]/
├── SKILL.md          — main reference document (YAML frontmatter + content)
├── scripts/          — optional helper scripts (if any)
└── examples/         — optional example files, templates, or configs (if any)
```

The `SKILL.md` file contains YAML frontmatter with `name`, `description`, and platform metadata, followed by the full reference content in Markdown.

## How Skills Work

- **On-demand loading**: Skills are loaded when an agent's task matches the skill's description. The agent invokes the skill via the `skill` tool, injecting the domain knowledge into context.
- **Agent frontmatter**: Agents declare which skills they use via the `skills:` field in their `.agent.md` frontmatter. The platform uses this to determine relevance.
- **VS Code Copilot**: Automatically injects skill content when the agent detects a matching task description. Skills appear in the Available Skills list and can be loaded via `/skill` commands.
- **OpenCode platform**: Skills are listed in the system prompt's `<available_skills>` block. The agent invokes `skill` with the matching name to load the full content.
- **Other platforms**: Each platform loads skills differently. Refer to platform-specific documentation for integration details.
