# MCP Security Hardening

Mandatory security measures for all MCP server usage in Pantheon agents.

---

## 1. Web/Fetch — Credential Leakage Prevention

### Affected Agents
Apollo, Athena, Gaia, Hephaestus, Iris, Nyx, Zeus (direct `web/fetch` tool)

### Rules

1. **Never embed credentials in URLs** — No API keys, tokens, or passwords in:
   - Query parameters (`?key=abc123`)
   - URL path segments (`/token/abc123/endpoint`)
   - Fragment identifiers (`#access_token=xyz`)

2. **Use environment variables for auth** — If an API requires authentication, use `Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN` header from env, never inline.

3. **Scrub URLs before logging** — Redact query params and path segments that look like credentials when logging fetch operations.

4. **URL allowlist for fetch** — Only fetch from:
   - Official documentation domains
   - Public RFCs (tools.ietf.org, datatracker.ietf.org)
   - Package registries (pypi.org, npmjs.com, crates.io)
   - Public GitHub repositories (github.com, raw.githubusercontent.com)

5. **Response content never stored** — Fetched content is for in-context analysis only. Never write fetch responses to disk or commit them.

6. **No credential forwarding** — Never pass credentials from one fetched response to another request without scrubbing.

### Audit
- If a fetch URL contains query parameters, log a redacted version: `/api/data?params=<redacted>`
- Flag any URL containing `token`, `key`, `secret`, `password`, `auth` in the URL path

## 2. Enforcement

These rules are enforced by **@themis** during code review:

| Risk Area | Themis Check | Severity if Violated |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| Credentials in fetch URLs | grep for `token=`, `key=`, `secret=` in URLs | HIGH — block review |

## 3. MCP Auto-Approve — Permission Tiers

Pantheon supports three permission tiers for MCP servers (valid values: `allow`, `ask`, `deny`):

| Tier | Behavior | When to Use |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `allow` | Auto-approve all tool calls | Trusted first-party servers (read-only resources) |
| `ask` | Prompt user for each tool call | Third-party servers or servers with write capabilities |
| `deny` | Block all tool calls | Untrusted or experimental servers |

### Rules

1. **Only pantheon-resources gets `allow` by default** — it's read-only, same trust boundary as the repo
2. **pantheon-code-mode starts at `ask`** — execution needs explicit confirmation
3. **Wildcard `*` is always `ask`** — unknown MCP servers never auto-approve
4. **`allow` is NOT a security bypass** — server-level access controls still apply (file permissions, path traversal protection)
5. **`allow` only covers MCP tool calls** — bash, websearch, and skill permissions are independent

### Audit
- Themis MUST verify `allow` is never set on external/untrusted MCP servers
- Any PR changing an MCP server from `ask` to `allow` requires explicit security review
